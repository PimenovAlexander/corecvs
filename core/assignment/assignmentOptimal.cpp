/**
 *
 *  This assignment algorithm uses the highly optimized version proposed by
 *  Daniel Shved
 *
 *  at http://acm.mipt.ru/twiki/bin/view/Algorithms/HungarianAlgorithmCPP
 *
 *  First of all - this version uses the optimization that allows not to store the
 *  duplicate of the matrix.
 *
 *  All assignment manipulations are limited to adding or subtracting
 *  value to of from column or row in whole. In this version the subtraction
 *  values are stored in the v and u arrays.
 *
 *
 *  Secondary - this algorithm processes matrix row by row.
 *
 *  If naive approach for assigning element in the newly added row doesn't work,
 *  (the column with the smallest element is already used in the assignment) *
 *  the algorithm analyzes the upper rows (markedI holds the currently analyzed row)
 *  until it will find a new collision-free assignment.
